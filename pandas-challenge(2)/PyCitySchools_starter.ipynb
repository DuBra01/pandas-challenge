    "Summary: School Performance and Spending Efficiency by School Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview: An analysis of Charter and District Schools reveals that Charter Schools consistently achieve higher performance metrics—including average math and reading scores, and passing rates—despite lower spending per student. District Schools, while spending more per student, show lower performance outcomes, suggesting a disparity in spending efficiency and resource allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Findings:\n",
    "\t1.\tCharter Schools:\n",
    "\t•\tOutperform District Schools in all measured academic metrics.\n",
    "\t•\tAchieve higher results with lower spending per student, likely due to efficient resource allocation and smaller class sizes.\n",
    "\t2.\tDistrict Schools:\n",
    "\t•\tHave higher per-student spending but lower performance outcomes.\n",
    "\t•\tLarger class sizes and increased administrative costs may reduce the direct impact of spending on student performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insights:\n",
    "\t•\tEfficiency in Charter Schools: Charter Schools make effective use of limited resources, focusing spending on instructional quality, which drives better academic results.\n",
    "\t•\tImprovement Opportunities for District Schools: District Schools could improve outcomes by adopting strategies from Charter Schools, such as targeted resource allocation and smaller class sizes, to make spending more impactful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "\t•\tOptimize Resource Allocation: District Schools could benefit from reviewing their spending efficiency, reallocating funds toward direct student support and instructional quality.\n",
    "\t•\tAdopt Best Practices: Implementing Charter School strategies, such as reducing class sizes and focusing on instructional spending, may improve performance in District Schools without necessarily increasing budgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This summary highlights the relationship between school type, spending efficiency, and performance, with clear recommendations for enhancing outcomes in District Schools."
